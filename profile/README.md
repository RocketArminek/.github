## My Personal Programming Lab

Welcome to my learning space where I explore different approaches to software engineering through hands-on experimentation and measurement.

## ðŸ”¬ What's Here

In this organization, you'll find projects that explore various engineering approaches:

### Modular Architecture
- Practicing separation between domain logic and infrastructure (databases, UI, external services)
- Trying different architectural patterns to understand their trade-offs
- Examples of domain isolation techniques I'm experimenting with

### Testing Journey
- Following test pyramid principles in my projects
- Discovering simulation testing as a fascinating evolution of traditional approaches
- Learning to measure quality through different metrics

### Exploring Different Perspectives
- Re-examining patterns I've learned like "Clean Code" and SOLID etc...
- Inspired by Casey Muratori's ["Clean" Code, Horrible Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD5NrevFtbU) to question more
- Experimenting to form my own understanding based on real measurements

### Learning Through Measurement
- Trying to back decisions with data where possible
- Learning about performance implications of different choices
- Building intuition through experimentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

### Learning Rust
- Exploring systems programming concepts
- Building small projects to understand memory management
- Discovering how low-level control affects performance

### Simulation Testing Discovery
- Learning about [FoundationDB's approach to testing](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/testing.html), [TiggerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com/) and [Turso](https://turso.tech/)
- Experimenting with deterministic testing techniques
- Curious about what comes after traditional testing methods

### Exploring Safety-Critical Patterns
- Reading about [The Power of 10 Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code)
- Discovering [TigerStyle](https://tigerstyle.dev/) principles
- Testing these ideas in practice to see what resonates
